# Creating an Entity

This functionality allows users to define new entities within the application.
An entity can be considered as an object or concept with specific properties and relationships.

When creating an entity, such as a "User", the user can define the structure and attributes of the entity.
This can be done by writing a code snippet that defines the entity.
In the example below, a simple "User" entity is created without additional properties.

## Code

<code-block src="entity.txt" include-lines="1,3"></code-block>

This code snippet shows the basic definition of a "User" entity.
As development progresses, more properties can be added to this entity.

## Output

<note>This is a concept image and not the actual result of the application.</note>

![A simple "User" entity](empty-entity.svg "A simple \"User\" entity")

The image above provides a visual representation of the created entity.
It serves as an example of how the entity might appear in a diagram or model within the application.
